                    With unprecedented importance being given to online
                    presence, the work interface has transformed from the static
                    space of a cubicle to the ever-changing dynamics of the
                    digital world. Pepper aims to bridge the gap between content
                    creators and those who demand it. We believe in equalizing
                    opportunities and creating a platform where talent meets
                    opportunity.

                    Pepper is a one-stop destination for content creation, that
                    aims to build an ecosystem of voice, video and vernacular.
                    We cater to a host of businesses, from small startups to
                    media houses to big MNCSâ€™s and are revolutionizing how
                    companies create and manage their content needs end to end.
                    Pepper has proven to be a better alternative to in-house
                    content teams. We can cater to content demands at a scale
                    which is not only faster but cost-effective as well. We aim
                    to be the biggest aggregator of freelance content creators
                    and be able to create content that can help businesses
                    change the way they do social.

                    Pepper is a platform for content creators where we thrive on
                    making sure that every content piece that a creator
                    contributes to is recognized and paid for, apart from making
                    sure they get regular feedback from us. We believe that a
                    creator should get his due acknowledgement, and that is what
                    we aim our platform to do.

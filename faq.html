                    That is why, we make sure that we formalize our association
                    with all our writers which gives them the power to pursue
                    legal routes if such case arises. Our credibility comes from
                    the fact that we have dealt with over 400 writers in the
                    past two years and have never faced any case of
                    non-clearance of issues.
